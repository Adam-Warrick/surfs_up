* The max temps for each month shows a difference of only 2 degrees. 
* The biggest change in temp range is when we compare the min degrees. We are showing an 8 degree difference.

# Summary

In order to make an accurate and informed decision we would need to look at every month of the year. This would help us create a trendline in weather patterns, which would ultimately give us an idea when peak season vs low season is. We can staff accordingly and change days open if needed in order to keep revenue generation.
